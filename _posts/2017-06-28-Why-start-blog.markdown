## 为什么开始写博客

>People have been writing journals and diaries since writing was invented. Writing down thoughts helps you to organize them, re-think them and archive them. The last point is specifically relevant to developers diaries. I had many moments of "hey, I ran into this thing before", and it took a lot of time to recall the solution. Writing interesting things down can help me find them later, and in general it is nice to track the progress of the solution of a problem.

>A weblog is special, here thoughts can be easily shared with other people... Sometimes it is very important to get an external opinion on something - otherwise how do you know you are right ?

>I wanted to start a weblog for a very long time. Don't know what eventually pushed me to it, but I hope it will last :-)

In fact,I will forgot what and how I have done,I just remember that when somebody ask me;

记忆力越来越下降，不得不开始写点东西记录一下;

记录一次能够保存N年，好记性不如烂笔头，还能惠及他人，何乐而不为呢？
